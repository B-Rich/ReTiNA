Overview:

ReTiNA is a Real Time Network Analysis system that has the ability to detect
nodes on a network, generate statistics on network traffic on that network,
and also the ability to detect attacks as they occur on the network while 
logging all of this information into a database in real time.

To start ReTiNA first make sure that you have all of the following installed:
	tcpdump
	snort
	nmap 5.51
	python
	mysql
	Linux Command tr
	Apache
	python-mysqldb
	

After installing the above you will need to setup and configure with the
correct configurations as shown in the database directory. You may also 
need to configure snort an example of this can be seen in the 
AttackDetection directory in the README file. It is advised that you read
all documentation before trying to run the system for the first time.

Note: You must add the correct team colors/names and subnets into the teams.cfg 
file so that the modules know what subnets to look for and the team associated with 
them.

Running:

To start ReTiNA you must call the ReTiNA.sh script as root. This script will
start all the other modules by calling there start script as well. If you want
to test individual components of ReTiNA you may go into that components directory
and call the start script with the correct arguments as shown in the ReTiNA.sh
script.

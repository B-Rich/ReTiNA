Attack Detection:

1. Added more snort rules

2. Change Attack Detection to use the database wrapper instead of implementing another python file to access the database

3. Change the name of the script to start attack detection from cyberstormsince.sh to StartAttackDetection.sh to be more uniform

4. Added parsing for more attack types 

5. Added config file for teams, "../teams.cfg"

6. Removed files such as: bla, bla1, blankLog.txt, and other log files (xml generation is now done by cgi script "AttackReport.cgi" in the ../cgi-bin folder

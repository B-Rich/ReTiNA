Traffic Statistics
Daniel Savage

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW IT WORKS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
trafficStats takes in two arguments.  One is a teams config file and the other is an IPTraf log generated by tcpdump.

Team info is parsed from the config file and returns a list of the team names as well as subnets

Each item recieved that contains a team name is given it's own list with an incoming and outgoing packet counter.

As packets are sent and received, the packet counters are incremented accordingly.  Periodically the data is written to the database using DatabaseWrapper and the packet counters are reset.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS   (for Linux)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Python:  "sudo apt-get install python"

tcpdump:  "sudo apt-get install tcpdump"

IPTraf:  "sudo apt-get install iptraf"


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RUNNING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running StartTrafficStats.sh should take care of everything.

It does all of the following:

	-kills all tcpdump calls that may still be running
	-starts a new tcpdump and creates the log file
	-starts trafficStats.py and passes the config file as well as the 			log file

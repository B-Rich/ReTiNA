Traffic Statistics:

1. Changed the stats table of the ReTiNA database to traffic_stats. Also changed the fields of the table
   to id, traffic_timestamp, team_name, incoming, and outgoing. Also changed the createRTdb.sql script
   so that it creates the database with these changes.

2. Changed the DatabaseWrapper.py addStats method. The method was changed to account for the changes made
   to the underlying database.

3. Removed the need for perl. Made it to where the logfile is parsed and the data is added to the database
   all in one python script. 

4. Changed from using IPTraf to TCPDump.

5. Changed the output of the cgi script to:
   
   <Statistics timestamp="123456789">
   <team name="white">
   <incoming packets="1234" />
   <outgoing packets="4321" />
   </team>
   <team name="red">
   <incoming packets="1234" />
   <outgoing packets="4321" />
   </team>
   <team name="blue">
   <incoming packets="1234" />
   <outgoing packets="4321" />
   </team>
   </Statistics> 

6. Changed the DatabaseWrapper.py getStats method in the cgi-bin folder to account for the new database table 
   format. 

7. Wrote script to start the whole thing, StartTrafficStats.sh

8. Removed doit, StatsDB.py, first.pl

9. Added a config file for the teams, teams.cfg.

README file for Node detection module of Real Time Network Analysis system

Overview:

The Node Detection module is designed to provide
a real-time situational awareness of active nodes
on a network, as well as providing OS information
and limited port activity information.

The system is intended to be used as a part of the
Cyber Storm System but can be used as a stand-alone
application.

Note:  This system makes use of Nmap for its network
detection.  It is important that the node detection
software is run on a network owned by the user or
that the user has permission to run on.  Failure to
secure permission could result in disciplinary action
by the user's ISP or the network administrator of any
any scanned networks.  By using this system, the user
agrees to take full responsibility for the actions of
the node detection software.

Note: For Cyber Storm usage NodeDetection gets KOTH box
information from XScore by calling a cgi script from
XScore hosted on an Apache web-server. How this is done
can be seen towards the top of the nmapNodeDet.sh.

Note: nodeLog.log is a sample of the output from
nmapNodeDet.sh. The log files used during execution
are stored in the log folder.

Installation:

The system requires little in the way of installation.
Simply make sure that you are using a Unix based OS that
has the Nmap and bash packages installed.

Running:

The program has no flags and uses the nodes.conf file for
all readily modifiable values.  These variables allow the
user to modify team names, IP addresses, ports to scan,
and node types for each team.  Detailed instructions for
modifying nodes.conf can be found in the config file.

nmapNodeDet.sh runs the Node Detection module and NodeDB.py
parses the Node Detection output and puts it into the database.

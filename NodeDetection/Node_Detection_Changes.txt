Changed made to Node Detection module by 2011
Senior Capstone class.


Node Detection

1. Changed the grep search string for the ping sweep nmap call. The output for 
   nmap -sP is different with the new version of nmap (5.21). The grep search
   string was updated to account for this change.

2. Changed the way that the script was checking for ownership of KOTH boxes. 
   The team names were hard coded. The nmapNodeDet.sh script now calls a cgi
   script hosted by XScore that provides the KOTH boxes that are up and their
   owners.

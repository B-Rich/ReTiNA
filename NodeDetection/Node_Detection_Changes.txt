Node Detection

1. Changed the grep search string for the ping sweep nmap call. The output for 
   nmap -sP is different with the new version of nmap (5.21). The grep search
   string was updated to account for this change.

2. Changed the way that the script was checking for ownership of KOTH boxes. 
   The team names were hard coded. We added a hash table to the nodes.conf file 
   that has each teams color for a key and the teams "name" for the value. We
   now ftp to the KOTH box, get the message of the day, and check each team's name
   against the team name in the message of the day. Ownership is then assigined based
   on the message of the day.

Changes Made to the database folder:

4/24/2011: Daniel Savage
	   

		createRTdb.sql:  
				`mydb` replaced with `ReTiNAdb`

		config.py:	
				`mydb` replaced with `ReTiNAdb
	
		DatabaseWrapper.py:
				addStats() added to take parameters for timestamp, incoming, outgoing, total_outgoing, 
						and teamName.  This created a more general set of information instead of tracking
						what goes where, we look at each node individually
